# YouTube Cookies Example File
# 
# To use YouTube cookies authentication:
# 1. Generate your cookies file using yt-dlp:
#    yt-dlp --cookies-from-browser chrome --cookies cookies.txt "https://www.youtube.com"
# 
# 2. Rename this file to 'cookies.txt' and replace content with your actual cookies
# 
# 3. NEVER commit the actual cookies.txt file to git!
#
# For Render deployment:
# - Use the Shell tab in Render dashboard to manually create cookies.txt
# - Or set up as a secret file in Render settings
#
# Format: Netscape HTTP Cookie File (automatically generated by yt-dlp)
